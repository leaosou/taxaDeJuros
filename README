== Welcome to "Taxa de Juros" application

This is a web scraping application intended to show in a bubble chart
the interest rates of credit operations charged in the Brazilian market.

The application is developed in Ruby on Rails.

Locally it can be run by first starting the WEBrick server in the command line
$ rails s

Then goes to the web browser and type one of the following URL's:

http://localhost:3000/
http://localhost:3000/bc_scrapper/proto

The application was done as a final project for the Advanced Techniques Lab 
course taken by me during the first semester of 2011 at the "Foundação Universa"
(http://www.universa.org.br/) under the Object Oriented Systems Analysis
program in Brasília, Brazil.

The assignment was to scrape a government web page containing
data of public interest but maybe of little inquisitiveness as it is
showed in the web page. The page should be scraped and then
its data should be showed in another web page in a more user-frendly
manner, ie in a graphical format that may help the reader to grasp 
the significance of the information more throughly.

The graphical solution chosen was the Protovis' Bubble Chart
as may be seen here: http://vis.stanford.edu/protovis/ex/bubble.html

The application goes about the solution by producing the javascript file
/taxaDeJuros/public/javascripts/flare.js

which is subsequently used by the Protovis graphical tookit that is
imported into the application (/taxaDeJuros/public/javascripts/protovis-r3.2.js)

The bubble chart itself shows the bank names in short format.
It is necessary to follow the link shown in the web page to see
the full names or enter the URL 

http://localhost:3000/bc_scrapper/pf_cheque_especial

to see them all.

Also it shows the banks' names sorted in three groups according
to their interest rates charged: menor, medio, maior (smaller,
medium, larger), which can also be seen in the flare.js file
generated by the application as described above.

The pages that I intended to scrape in this application are
the ones found at the Brazilian Central Bank web page as
shown bellow.

Taxas de juros de operações de crédito
(Interest rates of credit operations)

More specifically its branches under the "Pessoa física" heading:
